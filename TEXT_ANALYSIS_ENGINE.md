- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time analysis statistics

## ðŸŽ¯ Pattern Detection Capabilities

### Role Detection Patterns
- "You are", "Act as", "Assume the role of"
- "As a [profession/role]", "Take on the persona of"
- "Your role is", "You will be acting as"

### Task Detection Patterns
- Action verbs: "Analyze", "Create", "Generate", "Summarize"
- Imperative instructions: "Write a", "Develop", "Design"
- Task keywords: "Your task is", "Please", "I need you to"

### Constraints Detection Patterns
- Limiting phrases: "Don't", "Avoid", "Must not", "Never"
- Quantitative limits: "Within X words", "No more than", "Maximum"
- Format restrictions: "Only use", "Stick to", "Ensure that"

### Examples Detection Patterns
- Introduction phrases: "For example", "Example:", "Such as"
- Input/output patterns: "Input:", "Output:", "Q:", "A:"
- Sequential patterns: "Example 1", "First example"

### Output Format Detection Patterns
- Format specifications: "JSON", "XML", "CSV", "Markdown"
- Structure requirements: "bullet points", "numbered list", "table format"
- Response style: "concise", "detailed", "step-by-step"

## ðŸ§  Intelligence Features

### Contextual Analysis
- **Sequence Awareness**: Role typically comes before Task
- **Position Bonuses**: Sections at text beginning/end have higher confidence
- **Type Conflict Resolution**: Handle overlapping section detections
- **Length Appropriateness**: Different sections have optimal length ranges

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm
1. **Base Pattern Confidence** (0-100%)
2. **Position Multiplier** (Â±10%)
3. **Length Appropriateness** (Â±10%)
4. **Context Relevance Bonus** (Â±10%)
5. **Type-Specific Multiplier** (Â±5%)
6. **User Feedback Adjustment** (Â±20%)

### Learning & Adaptation
- Track user corrections for continuous improvement
- Adapt confidence scoring based on feedback patterns
- Support for custom pattern definition
- Statistics tracking for optimization

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics

### Analysis Speed
- **Processing Time**: < 50ms for typical prompts (< 2000 chars)
- **Confidence Calculation**: Multi-threaded scoring
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized pattern matching

### Accuracy Targets (Based on Implementation Plan)
- **Section Detection**: 80%+ correct identification
- **Confidence Correlation**: 85%+ accuracy for high-confidence predictions
- **Processing Performance**: < 2 seconds for 10,000 character inputs

## ðŸ”§ Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```typescript
import { useParser } from '../hooks/useParser';

const { analyzeText, isAnalyzing } = useParser();

const results = await analyzeText(`
You are a data scientist with expertise in machine learning.

Analyze the provided dataset and identify patterns that could predict customer churn.

Don't include personal opinions - stick to data-driven insights.

Present results in JSON format with key findings and recommendations.
`);
```

### Advanced Analysis with Options
```typescript
import { useAdvancedParser } from '../hooks/useParser';

const { analyzeWithOptions } = useAdvancedParser();

const results = await analyzeWithOptions(text, {
  minConfidence: 70,
  resolveOverlaps: true,
  maxSectionsPerType: 2
});
```

### Custom Pattern Detection
```typescript
const customPatterns = {
  role: [/you\s+must\s+be\s+([^.!?]*)/gi],
  task: [/complete\s+the\s+following\s+([^.!?]*)/gi]
};

const sections = await extractWithCustomPatterns(text, customPatterns);
```
